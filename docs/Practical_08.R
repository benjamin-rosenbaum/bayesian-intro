# In a recent study, 2 datasets were given to 174 research teams with the task to
# answer 2 research question, each. The authors collected results in form of 
# standarized effect sized and CIs, and performed additional meta-analyses.

# We here want to "replicate" the study with the 1st dataset "evolutionary ecology".
# "To what extent is the growth of nestling blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) 
# influenced by competition with siblings?" Report back to me if you found a positive,
# negative, or no effect of sibling competition on individual growth. 

# Each row in the data is 1 chick individual. Note that some chicks were transferred
# to other nests after hatching, to manipulate brood size.

# - What is an appropriate response variable?
# - Which predictors measure "competition with siblings"?
# - What other predictors have to be controlled for?
# - Are there important interactions?
# - Observations are not independent: Random effects and their structure?


# Some variables I looked into (grouping by me):

# day_14_tarsus_length
# day_14_weight
# 
# hatch_Area
# hatch_Box
# hatch_mom_Ring
# hatch_nest_dad_Ring
# hatch_nest_CS
# d0_hatch_nest_brood_size
# d14_hatch_nest_brood_size 
# 
# rear_area
# rear_Box
# rear_mom_Ring
# rear_dad_Ring
# rear_nest_CS
# rear_d0_rear_nest_brood_size
# d14_rear_nest_brood_size
# 
# rear_nest_trt                 5: increase 6: decrease 7: no net brood manipulation
# home_or_away                  1: home (not transferred) 2: away (was transferred)
# net_rearing_manipulation
# day14_measurer
# chick_sex_molec
# hatch_year

# use chains=3, cores=3, to run chains in parallel for speedup
# hint: because some LMMs can take ~10 min even with parallelization,
# run fixed effects models first and then add a random effects structure
